This repository contains the codes and the link to the data of our paper "Automatic Identification of Social Media Bots using Deepfake Text Detection" for reproducibility purposes.

The dataset we have used in this work is the "TweepFake" dataset published by Fagni et. al. ([link to their paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0251415), [link to the dataset files](https://www.kaggle.com/mtesconi/twitter-deep-fake-text)).

The architecture of our model and full details are explained in our paper.
