The 'othernextvlad.py' script is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gibalegg/mtcnn-nextvlad#NextVLAD) and is slightly modified for our use of NeXtVLAD in NLP. This implementation also includes the batch normalization and context gating from the [original NeXtVLAD paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCVW_2018/papers/11132/Lin_NeXtVLAD_An_Efficient_Neural_Network_to_Aggregate_Frame-level_Features_for_ECCVW_2018_paper.pdf).

The 'mynextvlad.py' script is our impementation of the NeXtVLAD.
